SYNOPSIS
==================================================================
This demo App provides a way to see the Weather Underground API in action. 
It is built using Intel's Cross Platform Development Kit (XDK) 
that lets you create mobile apps for smartphones and tablets using
standard web languages (HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript).
